### Briefly about me:

I worked a collaborated with programmers, web developers, and designers every day. I dived deep into the digital-world, i've took part in different area activities and i've completed tasks from various fields, and realized what I really enjoyed. So I made the choice to become a Frontend developer. I am a creative person with an excellent memory and the ability to think outside the box. I have the support of my family and high motivation to learn a new profession and get a good job.
