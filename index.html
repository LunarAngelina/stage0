        <h3>About</h3>
      </header>
      <p>I have always strived for a conscious approach to personal and professional development. 
         All my previous work experience had little to do with programming, but it's exactly what defined my 
         goal of becoming a developer
      </p>

      <p>For the past two years I have worked as an office manager in a digital-marketing agency. 
         I worked a collaborated with programmers, web developers, and designers every day. 
         I dived deep into the digital-world, i've took part in different area activities 
         and i've completed tasks from various fields, and realized what I really enjoyed.
      </p> 

      <p>I made the choice to become a Frontend developer. 
         I am a creative person with an excellent memory and the ability to think outside the box. 
         I have the support of my family and high motivation to learn a new profession and get a good job.
      </p>
